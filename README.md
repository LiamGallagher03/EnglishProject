# English Project

### Purpose?
Unlike the other projects I've made for GitHub, this one is only here to show my coding skills. 
This is not a simultion, but rather something I coded for an English projectto express my philosophy on happiness. 
I thought including this to my portfolio would be alright, since I spent ~1 hour on it.
